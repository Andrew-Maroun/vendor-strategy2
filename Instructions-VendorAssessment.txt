Objective


You are acting as the VP of Operations for an acquired company. Your goal is to analyze vendor spend data, identify major cost-saving opportunities, and present your findings—including an executive-level summary—to senior leadership.


This assessment simulates the real acquisition due diligence work expected in this role.


Files Provided


Vendor Analysis Assessment: A list of ~400 vendors and the spend over the last 12 months. This is real vendor data with modified names and costs.


Instructions
* Make a copy of the spreadsheet
* Rename it to include your name: Vendor Analysis Assessment – [Your Name].
* Make sure anyone with the link can view.
* Complete the tasks below


Part 1: Analyze Vendor Data


For each vendor in the list, complete the following:
1. Assign Department
   * Classify each vendor under a department (e.g., Engineering, G&A, Finance, Support, etc.).
2. Vendor Description
   * Provide a concise one-line description of what the vendor does.
3. Strategic Recommendation
   * Choose one action for each vendor:
      * Terminate – Vendor is no longer needed.
      * Consolidate – Multiple vendors serve the same function and should be streamlined.
      * Optimize – Useful vendor, but opportunity exists to reduce cost or usage.
⚠️ This is not a manual data-entry task. Please use Claude Code to generate and refine your outputs. We will not accept submissions from other AI tools or from claude.ai. The work must be done using the Claude Code CLI. Please include a README file that explains how you did everything.
Part 2: Identify Strategic Opportunities


In the Top 3 Opportunities tab, outline:
* The three highest-impact recommendations based on vendor data
* Each should include:
   * A summary title (e.g., “CRM Tool Consolidation”)
   * A brief explanation
   * An estimated annual savings in USD
Part 3: Summarize Methodology


In the Methodology tab, describe:


How you approached the task
* Which tools you used
* Prompts you created
* How you validated and quality-checked your work


Part 4: Executive Memo


On the Recommendations tab, write a 1-page executive memo:
* Audience: CEO and CFO
* Clearly summarize your findings and key savings opportunities
* Ensure it is clear, actionable, and aligned with C-level decision-making expectations


How you will be evaluated:
* Did you use the Claude Code CLI to categorize vendors accurately into appropriate departments?
* Are vendor descriptions concise, accurate, and specific (i.e., not “business services provider”)?
* Are recommendations realistic and strategic? Did you identify potential risk factors?
* Are the Top 3 opportunities specific, plausible, and financially justified?
* Did you clearly explain your methodology and tool usage?
* Did you quality-check the results (either with AI or manually) and document what the quality check looked for?
* Is the executive memo clearly formatted, succinctly written, and free of grammatical, spelling, and mathematical errors? Are the savings significant enough to move the needle for a $1 billion business?
* Is your project folder (Github or Google Drive) well organized, clearly documenting inputs, outputs, scripts they used (if any), and a readme file?
